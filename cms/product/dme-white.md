f_description: >-
  Don’t fucking censor yourself. Sterility leads to susceptibility. Make your
  work consistent but not fucking predictable. Dedicate yourself to lifelong
  fucking learning. Defy fucking convention. If you don’t test your will against
  the dissent of the world, it can never grow stronger. Creativity is a fucking
  work-ethic. Fuck. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy
  consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments
  containing irregular intervals of negative space.
